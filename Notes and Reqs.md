## T3 Basics - let's learn how to use cutting edge tech

### Basic Components
- Typescript - I'm still not sure what type safe means but I guess it has to do with making sure that the javascript code does not error out while the web app is online by catching possible null values and exceptions
- Tailwind - I've been using it for months now and It makes CSS quick and easy
- TRPC - This seems to be the router which actually makes the fetch requests that I made with the fetch api before, I can also write all of the backend routes and the data they will return using it
- Next.js - Compared to Vite this seems to be a much more fully realized framework including the routing which is already implemented, in comparison vite seems to be just the front end. A lot to learn here.
- Clerk for auth - The auth solution 
- Prisma for ORM - Creating the database schema and interacting with the data provided by planetscale
- Planetscale for the postgres database 
- Vercel for hosting - Free hosting for hobby users, automatic deployments
- Axiom for logging - Still not quite sure what this helps us with


# Improvements

Let's implement some features I have already implemented before in order to learn the stack.

## Profile and Posts
- Allow users to upload a background image for the profile background which will let the users select the part they want displayed just like twitter - Ended up using Clerk's auth component. 
- This could be a fun challenge separate from the Clerk Auth Changes
- Like and unlike #DONE 
- Following users, this might be tricky as the users are stored in clerk #DONE 
- See who the user is following and is being followed by. This will be 2 separate pages with their own urls just like twitter. #DONE 
- Allow users to follow users from the following/followers pages #DONE 
- Fix following or not following for the 2 pages for all the users #DONE 
- Clicking outside the modal or clicking escape should close the edit profile modal #DONE 


## Posts
- Editing posts #DONE 
- Deleting Posts #DONE 
- Clicking on the delete button should open a modal asking you to confirm before deleting the post. #DONE 
- Auto sizing text area and character counter #DONE 
- Tooltips for edited posts and icons #DONE 
- Posting pictures and not just text
- Retweeting
- Comments for tweets, further comments for them too. Implement twitter threads
- Sharing posts, meaning share a link on social media platforms
- Views per post
- Emoji selector
- Sharing audio files that can be played 


## Main Page
